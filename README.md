<br />
Housekeeping Book is a user-friendly application for monitoring monthly household expenses. In addition to calculating the average amount per month and the individual contribution per person, it also offers several other useful features.

<br />

### Project in planning: Vue Blueprint Project

This project provides a foundational structure for my future initiatives. It includes the deployment process using GitHub for showcasing on GitHub Pages. Technologies utilized include Vue with TypeScript for the frontend, .NET Core with C# for the backend, and MSSQL as the database.

<br />

### Upcoming project: Painting Gallery

This project aims to test my Vue blueprint and create a gallery for my paintings. Further details are still being developed.
